21,West Beach,"A beach which was long ago the floor of an ocean. The landscape is dotted with bizarre rock formations and the broken remains of ancient strangely-designed boats. Limited in one side by mountains, on another by the sea.
You can see a cave opening in the mountain side [N].",25,22,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
22,Beach,"A beach which was long ago the floor of an ocean. The landscape is dotted with bizarre rock formations and the broken remains of ancient strangely-designed boats. Limited in one side by mountains, on another by the sea.
You can see an animal-trodden path leading away between the stones [N] and along the shoreline [E] [W].",24,23,-1,21,-1,-1,-1,-1
23,East Beach,"A beach which was long ago the floor of an ocean. The landscape is dotted with bizarre rock formations and the broken remains of ancient strangely-designed boats. Limited in one side by mountains, on another by the sea.
You can see an outcropping in the mountain side [N], perfect for protection against rain",26,-1,-1,22,-1,-1,-1,-1
24,Stone Arch,"You are standing in front of a high stone arch. Its sides are carved out of the mountain sides and its top arching gracefully between them. It is overgrown with moss and flowers, obiously left without maintenance for a long time. 
A small animal trail snakes through the arch [N] and you hear the sea lapping at the beach behind you [S].",-1,-1,22,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
25,Cold Cave,"You are standing just inside the mouth of a cave, chilly air blowing past you to the outside [S]. 
Upon closer inspection you realize you're in a lost mine, rich with gold, silver, and diamonds, but you tread carefully, beware of poison gas and cave ins. There's a trickling sound coming in from the deeper darkness [N].",27,-1,21,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
26,Sheltered Outcropping,"You are standung under a wind-carved stone outcropping. You notice old signs of camping, and a stone circle for fire left behind. There is the sound of the sea coming in from the outside [S]",-1,-1,23,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
27,Cold Cave Entry,"You are standing inside the cave, cold wind rushing past you. There's some light coming in from the entrance behind you [S]. 
In front of you you notice in the dim light reflected from the precious stones that the tunnel splits into two: 
A path leading to the right [NE] and to the left [NW].",-1,-1,25,-1,28,-1,-1,29
28,Cold Cave Right Path,"As your eyes have adjusted to the darkness, you notice that the moist sea air condensates on the walls here, dripping down its sides. 
Upon closer inspection a darker area in the moist walls is revealed, presumably a cavern entrance [E]. In front of you the tunnel stretches into the darkness [N], blowing wind into the tunnel behind you [S].",31,30,27,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
29,Cold Cave Left Path,"As your eyes have adjusted to the darkness, you notice that the moist sea air condensates on the walls here, dripping down its sides. 
You carefully step among the rubble that is on the floor. The cave seems to go three ways from here. 
One has a cold wind blowing from it [NE], the other carries a scent of the sea [S]. The last one has air that is still [NW]. Stepping closer to it you notice that the air there smells like moss and rot.",-1,-1,27,-1,31,-1,-1,34
